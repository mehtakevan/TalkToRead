# **TalkToRead**:

Our project aims to empower the handicapped and visually impaired by providing a versatile file management tool. This Python script is a voice-controlled file manager that allows users to perform various file management operations using voice commands. The script uses speech recognition to understand user commands and performs actions such as creating files, reading files, renaming files, writing to files, opening PDFs, reading PDFs, opening images, playing audio files, and more. At the core of our mission is the belief that access to digital content should be a right, not a privilege. By breaking down barriers and enabling access for all, we are fostering independence and empowerment. Our script is a testament to this belief, as it has the potential to transform countless lives with just a few lines of code. Just one script can open up a world of possibilities, allowing individuals to navigate the digital landscape with ease and confidence
